# go-rest
RikData REST Builder is a Golang based application that uses dynamic entity definitions to map existing tables to map objects. As entities are created dynamically, you can configure all the objects as per your business requirement.

Ex: If your custom legacy application has 1000s of tables, but you want to expose only a few hundred tables and some columns of those tables using REST APIs, you can configure the REST builder to expose only those tables and fields. It also allows you to control Primary Fields, Required Fields, Insert Ony/Update Only Fields, OneToMany, ManyToOne mapping, etc.

# RikData OneApp
